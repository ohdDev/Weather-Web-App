# Weather-Web-App

## Description

this project is an educational project that I created to apply the concept of *using an API with JavaScript*.
I apply this concept using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. I used the current weather api in [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/current).
I created this project using this toturial: [Build a Weather app using HTML, CSS & JavaScript in 2020](https://youtu.be/n4dtwWgRueI)

## Installation

this is a simple html project all what you need to run the app is to download the project folder and browse index.html file using any browser.

## Usage

after you open the page in your browser you should type the city name in the text form and the app will fetch the current weather data from the api and display it.
